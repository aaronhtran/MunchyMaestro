Good day,

This is a project made from scratch using swift and The Meal DB, a REST API to show various recipes from aronud the world.
The MunchMaestro project was made to show off this API using a clean and straightforward iOS application. 
The app's main focus is the Dessert section, hence the name. The app targets users who are looking for a sweet munch to snack on, but offers other savory meals as well.
